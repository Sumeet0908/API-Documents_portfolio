# API Documentation Practice Portfolio

## Overview
This repository contains API documentation written as part of hands-on practice
to learn API testing using Postman and API documentation using Markdown.

The repository reflects a progressive learning approach, starting with basic
documentation and gradually applying stricter technical writing standards.

## Tools Used
- API Reference: JSONPlaceholder
- Postman for API testing
- Markdown (.md) using VS Code for documentation
- Git and GitHub for version control and portfolio sharing

## API Source
All APIs documented in this repository are public dummy REST APIs used only for
learning and practice purposes.

Primary source:
- [JSONPlaceholder — https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users).

## APIs Documented So Far

### Read APIs
- GET /users — Retrieve list of users
- GET /users/{id} — Retrieve user by ID

### Create APIs
- POST /users — Create a new user
- POST /login — User login simulation

### Update APIs
- PUT /users/{id} — Update existing user details
- PUT /users/{id} — Update existing user details (with error handling).

> Note: Some APIs were documented earlier during initial learning stages and may
> follow simpler documentation patterns. Newer documentation applies improved,
> evidence-based writing standards.

## Learning Approach
- APIs are first tested in Postman
- Documentation is written based only on observed behavior
- Assumptions about validation, storage, or errors are avoided unless verified
- Folder structure follows CRUD principles for clarity
- Documentation quality is improved incrementally with practice

## What Was Practiced Today
- PUT /users/{id} — Update API documentation
- Testing PUT request in Postman
- Writing request body and success response
- Adding realistic error handling scenarios
- Maintaining consistent API references

## Upcoming Practice
- Request validation scenarios
- Further refinement of existing API docs

## Version Control Note
This repository uses Git for version control.
Older and newer versions of all documentation files (including API docs and README)
are preserved and can be viewed through commit history.

## Note
This repository represents an active learning portfolio.
Documentation structure, clarity, and depth will continue to improve over time.
